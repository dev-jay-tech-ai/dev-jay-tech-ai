I've been the sole software engineer for a luxury E-commerce company. <br>
I worked closely with business owners, implementing solutions to tackle various business challenges. <br>
<br>
I automated repetitive tasks and improved inefficient processes, <br>
leading to a remarkable 70% reduction in the operations team's work hours. <br>
This continuous development of the back office significantly cut down the time spent on simple and routine tasks.
